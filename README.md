âœ… Best candidates for exclusive loyalty programs and high-tier memberships.

Cluster 2 â€“ Growing Customers

a. Moderate spending, young to adult age group
b. Mixed payment methods
c. Some younger customers spend significantly
âœ… Potential to be nurtured into high-value customers through incentives and personalized engagement.

Cluster 3 â€“ Casual Spenders

a. Mature customers with decent spending
b. Use modern payment methods
âœ… Good target for limited-time premium offers; may need nudges for consistent loyalty.

Cluster 4 â€“ Low-Spending Customers

b. Rely mostly on cash payments
c. Age group: very young or elderly
âœ… Can be activated through awareness campaigns, bundled discounts, or social-value promotions.
